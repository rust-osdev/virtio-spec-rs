//! This crate contains the Rust equivalents of the definitions from the [Virtual I/O Device (VIRTIO) Specification](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec).
//! This crate aims to be unopinionated regarding actual VIRTIO drivers that are implemented on top of this crate.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! We recommend to rename this crate to `virtio` when adding the dependency.
//! This allows closely matching the specification when using definitions:
//!
//! - `VIRTIO_NET_F_CSUM` from the specification becomes [`virtio::net::F::CSUM`] in this crate.
//! - `virtio_net_config` from the specification becomes [`virtio::net::Config`] in this crate.
//!  
//! [`virtio::net::F::CSUM`]: net::F::CSUM
//! [`virtio::net::Config`]: net::Config
//!
//! Either run
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo add virtio-spec --rename virtio
//! ```
//!
//! or manually edit your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! virtio = { package = "virtio-spec", version = "x.y.z" }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! This crate has the following Cargo features:
//!
//! - `alloc` enables allocating unsized structs such as [`virtq::Avail`] and [`virtq::Used`] via the [`allocator_api2`] crate.
//! - `mmio` enables the [`mmio`] module for Virtio Over MMIO.
//! - `nightly` enables nightly-only functionality.
//! - `pci` enables the [`pci`] module for Virtio Over PCI via the [`pci_types`] crate.
//! - `zerocopy` derives the following traits for most structs:
//!   - [`zerocopy::KnownLayout`]
//!   - [`zerocopy::Immutable`]
//!   - [`zerocopy::FromBytes`]
//!   - [`zerocopy::IntoBytes`]
//!
//! # Implementation Status
//!
//! This crate adds new modules by demand.
//! If you need anything that is not available yet, please open an issue.
